<p>The system of a queue is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>the customer arrival process (e.g.&nbsp;poisson process)</li>
<li>the service duration (e.g.&nbsp;exponential law)</li>
<li>the number of servers</li>
<li>the maximum number of customers in the system (buffer)</li>
<li>service discipline (e.g.&nbsp;FIFO), possible service classes (priorities), etc.</li>

<p><span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> is the <strong>arrival time</strong> of customer number <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(U_i = T_{i+1} - T_1\)</span> is the <strong>interarrival-time</strong> between customers number i and (i+1).</p>
<p>In simple models, we assume that <strong>successive inter-arrival times</strong> <span class="math inline">\(U_1, U_2, U_3, ...\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>are <strong>independent</strong></li>
<li>follow the <strong>same probabibility distribution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The customer arrival process is then fully characterized by the <strong>law of inter-arrival times</strong>.</p>

<section id="poisson-arrivals" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="poisson-arrivals">Poisson arrivals</h3>
<p>A particular case of arrival processes is the Poisson process in which the successive <em>inter-arrival times</em> <span class="math inline">\(U_1, U_2, U_3, ...\)</span> are independent, and distributed according to the <strong>exponential law with parameter</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. Equivalently , the <em>arrival process</em> is a <strong>Poisson process with parameter</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(U_i \geq u) = e^{-\lambda u}
\]</span></p>
<p>The arrival rate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the <strong>the average number of arrivals per time unit</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;patients per hour). The <strong>average inter-arrvial time</strong> s equals <span class="math inline">\(1/\lambda\)</span> (time units, e.g.&nbsp;hours)</p>

<section id="number-of-servers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="number-of-servers">Number of servers</h3>
<p>In a system with multiple servers, there cannot be any customers waiting if at least one server is idle. As soon as one server is freed, a customer among those waiting uses it (if the waiting buffer is not empty).</p>
<p>It is generally assumed that servers are identical, meaning that the distribution of service durations is the same for all servers.</p>
</section>
<section id="waiting-buffers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="waiting-buffers">Waiting buffers</h3>
<p>The <strong>maximum number of customers</strong> in the system is the sum of the number of positions in the waiting buffer and the number of servers.</p>
<p>If a customer arrives to a finite buffer that is full, this customer is lost (blocked). This is called a <strong>blocking queue</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>evolution over time of the number of customers</strong> in the system (waiting or being served) is modeled by a <strong>random process</strong>.</p>
